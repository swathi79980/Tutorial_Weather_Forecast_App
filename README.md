# Weather_Forecast_App using openweather_api
In this Python project, I learned to make a python app that will collect weather information such as current temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, weather description and many others, of any place on the earth, using OpenWeatherMap API. This project is going to be very short and simple. One just need to invest 30 min to understand everything.This app can find these weather information in real time by just typing the city name. One will be able to get the data about only those places which are listed (or supported) by OpenWeatherMap website.

Project Requirements:-

i)Python version 3.5 and above (Though lower version should also work)

ii)Python 'requests' module should be installed.

iii)Creating a free account on OpenWeatherMap and accessing API key.

The steps to be followed are mentioned below:-

1.Creating a free account on OpenWeatherMap and accessing API key.

2.Storing the API key to the Windows Environment Variables and accessing this information confidentially.

3.Creating API request from Python

4.Data interpretaion 

5.Showing the result and the result should be easily understanding to the user.
